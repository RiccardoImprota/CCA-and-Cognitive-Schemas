--------

This project constitutes the final deliverable for the Computational Social Science course at the University of Trento, academic year 2020/2021.

My paper _Culture Schemas and “Culture Zones”: an exploratory data analysis_ related to this repository is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ggUyp9VBh14gz6XV9inPLSBQXtylILX0/view?usp=sharing)

Project objective:
 * An exploratory analysis on cognitive schemas conducted with Correlational Class Analysis on World Values Survey Data 

--------

In this project I use a Correlational Class Analysis (CCA) to try to measure "shared understanding" across respondents of different cultures. To do so, I use data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and the notion of Culture Zones from "The Inglehart-Welzel World Cultural Map".

I use CCA on the 6  variables that were used by Inglehart (1997) to create the Cultural Map and that he selected with a PCA. I then divided the subjects into 3 different "Cognitive Schema Classes" and used a random forest to find the most predictive variables for the creation of these classes with the CCA.
